Project provides a webpage which allows the user to find all anagrams of any given 7-letter combination.
Files required to run are RainbowAssistant.html and wordmap.js, in the same directory.
Other files are for reference only, and would be required if the data dictionary was to be modified.

The user will load a webpage, RainbowAssistant.html, which accesses wordmap.js.

File words.txt is a simple alphabetical text list of all 7-letter words.
File wordmap.js is a recreation of words.txt in JS format, with a precomputed signature list enabling instant lookup.
There is a helper script "make_wordmap.js" to generate "wordmap.js" from "words.txt".
